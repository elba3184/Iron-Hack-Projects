        <h1>ADVANCING THE FUTURE</h1>
        <p> As one of the world’s fastest growing providers of launch services, SpaceX has secured over
            100 missions to its manifest, representing over $12 billion on contract. These include commercial
            satellite launches as well as US government missions. SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft is flying numerous
            cargo resupply missions to the space station under a series of Commercial Resupply Services contracts.
            Dragon was designed from the outset to carry humans to space and will soon fly astronauts under NASA’s
            Commercial Crew Program. Building on the achievements of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX is working
            on a next generation of fully reusable launch vehicles that will be the most powerful ever built,
            capable of carrying humans to Mars and other destinations in the solar system.</p>

                    <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting
                        destinations. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning
                        significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was
                        designed from the beginning to carry humans. The first demonstration flight under NASA's
                        Commercial Crew Program launched on March 2, 2019 at 2:49 a.m. ET. The Dragon spacecraft
                        successfully docked with the space station ahead of schedule at 6:02 a.m. ET on March 3, 2019,
                        becoming the first American spacecraft in history to autonomously dock with the International
                        Space Station.</p>

                    <p>OVERVIEW
                        The Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 7 passengers to and from Earth orbit,
                        and beyond. The pressurized section of the capsule is designed to carry both people and
                        environmentally sensitive cargo. Towards the base of the capsule and contained within
                        the nose cone are the Draco thrusters, which allow for orbital maneuvering.

                        Dragon’s trunk not only carries unpressurized cargo but also supports the spacecraft
                        during ascent. The trunk remains attached to Dragon until shortly before reentry
                        into Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
